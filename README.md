I have a degree in Computer Science from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS) and I am currently a master's student in Computer Science from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). I am interested in the areas of artificial intelligence and data mining. My work at the end of graduation aimed to assist in the understanding of the spread of yellow fever in a population (Epidemiological simulation of the spread of yellow fever using Multiagent Systems and Geoprocessing techniques).
